# BIOF 501 Term Project: RNASeq workflow for differential expression and gene summarization 

# Background and Rationale
## • include the what’s and why’s – also your aims
## • include any package dependencies that are required (bullet points are ok for this)
## • You can include your DAG here

# Usage
## Make sure you format everything so that step by step usage details are included. ## If we can’t run your pipeline then we can’t give you marks.
## • Installation (if necessary) including any datasets that are to be used if they are not provided
## (i.e. how to download them using wget or curl – exact paths need to be specified and the data must be accessible)
## • Exact step by step usage with descriptive comments on what action is being performed in each step
